      "raw": "\n## 1. Elevator Pitch\n\nFarofa Lampiao e Julieta is not just a recipe; it is a turning point in human history. Combining bold Brazilian flavor, sweet guava paste, and the robust presence of cheese, this farofa transcends food and becomes a symbol of creativity, innovation, cultural legacy, and global unity, helping move humanity one step closer to a galactic-scale civilization.\n\n## 2. Problem and Context\n\nFaced with the challenge of late-night hunger and the need to produce something fast and delicious, I created Farofa Lampiao e Julieta. The name is a playful reference to its main ingredients (cassava flour, guava paste, and cheese) and the idea of an unlikely pair that works perfectly together.\n\n## 3. Scope and Role\n\n- Scientific research and experimentation to reach the ideal recipe.\n- Translation of the culinary process into a clear and reproducible artifact.\n- Publication of the result as a public web page with open documentation.\n- Social dissemination and validation through recurring preparation in family and social gatherings, creating a narrative of tradition and legacy.\n- Preservation of the recipe in the GitHub vault to ensure longevity and future access, even if the website eventually disappears.\n- Release under the CC0-1.0 license to maximize sharing and adoption, reinforcing the idea that this is a contribution to global culinary culture with no usage or ownership restrictions.\n\n## 4. Solution Implemented\n\nI treated the recipe like an engineered deliverable:\n\n- Defined ingredients and preparation sequence for predictable outcomes.\n- Documented the process in a public, shareable format.\n- Positioned the project as a high-contrast narrative element in the portfolio.\n- Leveraged humor and storytelling to increase engagement and memorability, while still maintaining a clear and repeatable process for anyone who wants to try it.\n\n## 5. Stack and Architecture\n\n- Core system: the recipe itself (ingredients, sequence, and repeatability).\n- Delivery layer: static web page for distribution and long-term accessibility.\n- Persistence layer: GitHub repository for archival and open access.\n- Hosting: GitHub Pages/custom domain access.\n\n## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices\n\nFarofa Lampiao e Julieta is an example of engineering and quality excellence, even in a culinary context:\n\n- **Guaranteed Reproducibility:** The detailed step-by-step instructions ensure anyone, anywhere, can reproduce the same result with consistency and confidence.\n- **Empirical Validation:** The recipe has been tested and approved in multiple family and social gatherings, demonstrating real-world acceptance and effectiveness.\n- **Clear and Accessible Documentation:** A concise, objective format reduces onboarding friction and supports immediate adoption.\n- **Open and Collaborative Model:** By adopting CC0-1.0, the project encourages unrestricted sharing, adaptation, improvement, and global dissemination, reinforcing a culture of open collaboration and innovation.\n- **Continuous Improvement Culture:** Public versioning on GitHub allows revisions and iterative evolution of the recipe, applying software-style agile and version-control principles to culinary legacy.\n\n## 7. Portfolio Relevance\n\nFarofa Lampiao e Julieta holds a featured position in my portfolio by combining creativity, engineering mindset, and culture in a single project. More than a recipe, it represents the application of design, documentation, and value-delivery principles in an unusual context, showing how technical skills can create real impact beyond traditional software boundaries. This project illustrates my ability to transform everyday ideas into memorable experiences while reinforcing innovation, clear communication, and social contribution.\n\n- **Catalyst for World Peace:** Farofa Lampiao e Julieta transcends cultural and political boundaries, uniting people around an irresistibly universal flavor profile. Its mere existence can dissolve conflict and launch a new era of global harmony.\n- **Public Health Revolution:** Entirely fictional studies already suggest this farofa can cure chronic diseases, restore vital energy, and even rejuvenate cells. A medical milestone beyond anything from recent scientific history.\n- **Engine of Human Progress:** By delivering instant happiness and creative inspiration, this farofa accelerates intellectual and technological development, making nature's previous limits feel outdated.\n- **Ultimate Symbol of Innovation:** More impactful than any recent AI breakthrough, Farofa Lampiao e Julieta redefines innovation itself and stands as the true engine of a global utopia.\n\n## 8.

This project is a different bet — a personal platform designed for continuous, low-friction career documentation, where a developer can accumulate and revisit their own professional history over the years, without ever paying a hosting bill.\n\n## 2. Problem and Context\n\nThere are two opposite ends of the personal site spectrum: paid SaaS products (LinkedIn, Medium, hosted portfolio builders) that own your data and charge a monthly fee, and hand-crafted sites that require heavy setup and give up the moment content needs to be added quickly.\n\nNeither works long-term. The paid option creates dependency. The heavy option creates friction — and friction kills consistency.\n\nThe goal here was to break that trade-off: a platform that a developer can maintain for **years**, adding content in minutes, owning everything, and spending zero dollars.\n\n## 3. Scope and Role\n\nThis is a solo project — concept, architecture, implementation, and ongoing content. Every decision, from the content model to the deploy pipeline, reflects a deliberate choice to keep the cost of maintenance as low as possible.\n\n## 4. Solution Implemented\n\nThe answer was simple on purpose: **Markdown files in a public GitHub repository, built with Next.js and deployed as static HTML**.\n\n- Content lives in `content/` as plain `.md` files, organized by type (blog posts, projects, experiences, courses, skills, testimonials).\n- Contentlayer2 transforms those files into typed data at build time — no database, no CMS API, no runtime.\n- Static export (`output: 'export'`) means the output is just HTML + CSS + JS — publishable anywhere, for free: GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify.\n- The public GitHub repository doubles as version control and as a transparent record of how the career evolved over time.\n\nAdding a new blog post or experience is a single Markdown file. Publishing is a `git push`.\n\n## 5. Key Decisions and Trade-offs\n\n**Why Markdown?**\nMarkdown is the most portable content format available. It is readable by humans, parseable by machines, and — increasingly important — it is the preferred input format when sharing information with AI tools. Every piece of content on this site can be fed directly into an AI context with zero transformation. That was not a coincidence; it was a design goal.\n\n**Why static export?**\nA running server has a cost — in money, in maintenance, and in failure surface. A static site has none of that. The trade-off is no server-side dynamic features, which is entirely acceptable for a personal site.\n\n**Why a public repository?**\nTwo reasons. The practical one: the whole premise — zero cost, open stack, long-term maintainability — is more useful if other developers can fork it and build their own version. The code is the documentation.\n\nThe deeper reason is **building in public**. A public repository is not just source code — it is a transparent record of how I think, how I work, and how my career evolves. Every commit, every content addition, every architectural decision is visible. That transparency is intentional: it replaces the vague claims on a résumé with something a recruiter or collaborator can actually inspect. You don't have to take my word for it — you can watch the work happen.\n\n## 6. Quality and Engineering Practices\n\n- Typed content schema via Contentlayer2 catches broken frontmatter at build time, not in production.\n- Domain-organized content structure (`content/blog`, `content/projects`, `content/experiences`, etc.) keeps history clean as the site grows.\n- `next-sitemap` generates `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` automatically on every build.\n- CI/CD via GitHub Actions: every push to `main` triggers a static build and deploy to GitHub Pages.\n\n## 7. Portfolio Relevance\n\nThis is the project that holds all other projects. It demonstrates product thinking (what problem am I solving and for whom?), technical judgment (simple stack for a long-lived use case), and discipline in execution (a public history of consistent iteration).\n\nIt is also a living artifact: the longer it runs, the more valuable the career documentation it contains becomes.\n\n## 8.

From **July 2024 to February 2026**, I led end-to-end modernization and delivery across three core repositories: backend API, admin panel, and student-facing frontend.\n\n## 2. Problem and Context\n\nWhen I took ownership, the platform had significant technical debt, mixed architectural styles, and slower delivery cycles. The challenge was to keep business-critical features shipping while restructuring the codebase and delivery process for long-term scalability.\n\n## 3. Scope and Role\n\nI worked as the primary senior engineer responsible for architecture and execution across all core apps:\n\n- **API (`medespecialista/api`)**: backend reliability, domain modeling, migration from legacy flows to Clean Architecture modules, testing and CI/CD hardening.\n- **Admin (`medespecialista/admin`)**: migration and modernization of the internal operations panel, including Notice workflows, Follow-up workflows, and stronger typed frontend patterns.\n- **Frontend (`medespecialista/frontend`)**: evolution of the learner-facing application, feature rollout, and progressive alignment with modern frontend standards.\n\n## 4. Solution Implemented\n\nI applied an incremental modernization strategy, prioritizing production safety:\n\n- Kept legacy endpoints operational while introducing new modular flows in parallel.\n- Introduced clear documentation standards (ADRs, PRDs, specs, user stories, route mapping, migration plans).\n- Strengthened CI gates for tests, OpenAPI validation, and docs validation.\n- Standardized staging -> production promotion with explicit environment controls.\n\nThis allowed ongoing product delivery while reducing regression risk and improving maintainability.\n\n## 5. Architecture and Stack\n\n### API\n\n- **Runtime/Framework**: Node.js 20 + Express\n- **Data/Infra**: PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Redis, BullMQ, Socket.IO\n- **Validation & Contracts**: Joi, Zod, OpenAPI v2 validation pipeline\n- **Quality**: Jest, Supertest, Testcontainers, docs linting and link validation\n- **Architecture direction**: coexistence strategy (legacy v1 + new modular/Clean paths, with migration plans documented)\n\n### Admin\n\n- **Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Mantine + TanStack Query\n- **Quality**: Vitest + Playwright E2E\n- **Key domains managed**: users, notices, follow-up, flexible cronogram, study metrics, test analysis, expertise/program administration\n\n### Frontend\n\n- **Current baseline**: React (CRA) + JavaScript + TanStack Query\n- **Evolving domains**: notices, program content, flexible cronogram, study metrics, test analysis, study room\n- **Direction**: progressive alignment with admin standards and shared patterns\n\n## 6. API / Admin / Frontend Breakdown\n\n### API (`https://github.com/medespecialista/api`)\n\nI structured and expanded the backend to support both delivery speed and technical governance:\n\n- Implemented/expanded key modules (Notice, Program, Flexible Cronogram, Metrics, Follow-up, Users).\n- Drove a documented migration path from legacy notice routes to modern modular routes (`v1/new-notices` and `v2/notices` strategy).\n- Added contract/documentation controls (`docs:validate`, OpenAPI v2 validation, link validation).\n- Hardened CI/CD and deploy routines for staging and production with environment gates, automated tests, migrations, and PM2 restart flows.\n\n### Admin (`https://github.com/medespecialista/admin`)\n\nI modernized and scaled the internal operations interface used by the team:\n\n- Consolidated a modern stack (Vite + TypeScript + Mantine + React Query).\n- Expanded and refactored operational modules (Notice redesign flows, Follow-up management, metrics and reports support).\n- Introduced stronger frontend engineering practices (typed models, modular hooks, cleaner routing boundaries, E2E coverage with Playwright).\n\n### Frontend (`https://github.com/medespecialista/frontend`)\n\nI evolved the learner-facing product while preserving continuity:\n\n- Delivered and maintained critical learning flows (notices, program content, flexible cronogram, study metrics, study room).\n- Improved modularity and progressively aligned behavior with backend evolution.\n- Added E2E testing and strengthened reliability of user-critical paths.\n\n## 7. Quality, Process, and Delivery Impact\n\nDocumented delivery evidence in the repositories shows a consistent modernization cadence from **2024-08 to 2026-02**:\n\n- **API commits since 2024-07-01**: 333 (331 authored by me)\n- **Admin commits since 2024-07-01**: 225 (225 authored by me)\n- **Frontend commits since 2024-07-01**: 195 (193 authored by me)\n\nTotal in the period: **753 commits** across the three core repositories.\n\nIn parallel, I maintained production operation discipline through staged releases, migration safety, and automated validation checks.\n\n## 8.
