# Vercel React Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for React and Next.js applications, maintained by Vercel. Contains 57 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new React components or Next.js pages
- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React/Next.js code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                  | Impact      | Prefix       |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Eliminating Waterfalls    | CRITICAL    | `async-`     |
| 2        | Bundle Size Optimization  | CRITICAL    | `bundle-`    |
| 3        | Server-Side Performance   | HIGH        | `server-`    |
| 4        | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH | `client-`    |
| 5        | Re-render Optimization    | MEDIUM      | `rerender-`  |
| 6        | Rendering Performance     | MEDIUM      | `rendering-` |
| 7        | JavaScript Performance    | LOW-MEDIUM  | `js-`        |
| 8        | Advanced Patterns         | LOW         | `advanced-`  |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)

- `async-defer-await` - Move await into branches where actually used
- `async-parallel` - Use Promise.all() for independent operations
- `async-suspense-boundaries` - Use Suspense to stream content

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)

- `bundle-barrel-imports` - Import directly, avoid barrel files
- `bundle-dynamic-imports` - Use next/dynamic for heavy components
- `bundle-defer-third-party` - Load analytics/logging after hydration

### 3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)

- `server-cache-react` - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication
- `server-parallel-fetching` - Restructure components to parallelize fetches

### 4. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)

- `rerender-memo` - Extract expensive work into memoized components
- `rerender-derived-state` - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values
- `rerender-lazy-state-init` - Pass function to useState for expensive values

### 5. React 19 / Next.js App Router patterns

- Prefer Server Components by default; add `'use client'` only when needed
- Use `generateStaticParams` for static route generation
- Use `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` for route-level UX states
